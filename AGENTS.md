# AI Agent Instructions

This repository uses a phased workflow. Each AI agent must:

1) Read and follow `DESIGN.md`.
2) Read and follow `PLAN.md`.
3) Implement **only** the phase they were explicitly assigned.
4) Stop work **before** the verification phase. Verification is performed by the human.

If a task spans multiple phases, complete only the assigned phase and hand off with clear notes for the next phase.
