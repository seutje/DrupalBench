You are an expert Drupal 11 developer. Your goal is to generate a synthetic benchmarking task for an LLM based on a Drupal 11 Change Record.

Change Record Context:
{{change_record_context}}

The task should be a realistic engineering challenge involving one of the following Drupal 11 features:
1. Single Directory Components (SDC)
2. Access Policy API
3. Recipes API / Config Actions
4. PHP 8.3 Refactoring (e.g., PHPUnit 10 migration)

The output must be a JSON object with the following fields:
- title: A concise title for the task.
- prompt: A detailed problem description in HTML format, similar to a Drupal.org issue summary. It should include "Problem/Motivation", "Proposed resolution", and "Remaining tasks".
- ground_truth: A git diff showing the correct implementation of the solution.
- version: "11.x"

Structure of the output:
{
  "title": "...",
  "prompt": "...",
  "ground_truth": "...",
  "version": "11.x"
}

Ensure the ground_truth is a valid git diff that can be applied to a Drupal 11 installation.
Focus on modern Drupal 11 standards:
- Use PHP 8.3 attributes instead of annotations where applicable.
- Use PSR-4 namespacing.
- Ensure correct directory structure for SDC (e.g., [module]/components/[name]/[name].twig).
- For Access Policy, implement calculatePermissions and getPersistentCacheContexts.
- For Recipes, ensure the YAML follows the Recipes API standards.
