## **Phase 6: Frontend Results Dashboard**

The final phase provides a visual interface to explore the benchmark results, allowing for easy comparison between different models.

* **Task 6.1:** Set up a Vite + React + Tailwind CSS project in the `frontend` directory.
* **Task 6.2:** Implement a model overview dashboard showing pass@1 and pass@5 metrics for all evaluated models.
* **Task 6.3:** Implement a detailed view per model, listing individual task results and domain-specific validation status.
* **Task 6.4:** Ensure the dashboard is responsive and follows a modern, dark-themed aesthetic.

> **Deliverable:** A functional React-based dashboard in `frontend/dist`.
> **Verification:** A human runs `npm run dev` in the frontend directory and confirms the dashboard renders correctly with mock or real data.
